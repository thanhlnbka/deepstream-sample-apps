===============================================================================
1. Prerequisites:
===============================================================================

Please follow instructions in the apps/sample_apps/deepstream-app/README on how
to install the prerequisites for Deepstream SDK, the DeepStream SDK itself and the
apps.

Install cmake: https://cmake.org/download/

===============================================================================
2. Purpose:
===============================================================================

This document shall describe about the sample deepstream-test1 application.

It is meant for demonstration of how to use the various DeepStream SDK
elements in the pipeline and extract meaningful insights from a video stream using the service-maker API.

===============================================================================
3. To compile:
===============================================================================

  $ mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make

===============================================================================
4. Usage:
===============================================================================

  Run with the h264 elementary stream. In this method, user needs to modify the source
    code of deepstream-test1-app to configure pipeline properties.

    $ ./deepstream-test1-app <h264_elementary_stream>

    Or

    $ ./deepstream-test1-app <pipeline config in yaml>

NOTE: To compile the sources, run make with "sudo" or root permission.

This sample creates instance of "nvinfer" element
for inference. The "nvinfer" element uses TensorRT API to infer
on frames/objects. "nvinfer" element is configured through its
config file. Using a correct configuration for a inference element
instance is therefore very important as considerable behaviors of the instance
are parameterized through these configs.

For reference, here is the config file used for this sample :
1. The 4-class detector (referred to as pgie in this sample) uses
    dstest1_pgie_config.yml

In this sample, we create one instance of "nvinfer",
referred as the pgie. This is a 4 class detector and it detects the classes
"Vehicle , RoadSign, TwoWheeler, Person".
The inference element attaches inference metadata to the buffer. By attaching
the probe at the end of the pipeline, one can extract meaningful
information from this inference. Please refer the "ObjectCounter::handleData"
function in the sample code.
