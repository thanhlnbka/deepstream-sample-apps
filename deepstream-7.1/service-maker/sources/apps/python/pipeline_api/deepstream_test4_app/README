1. Prerequisites:
===============================================================================

Please follow instructions in the apps/sample_apps/deepstream-app/README on how
to install the prerequisites for Deepstream SDK, the DeepStream SDK itself and the apps.

#Deepstream msgbroker supports sending messages to Azure(mqtt) IOThub, kafka, AMQP broker(rabbitmq) and Redis

Dependencies
------------

 Azure Iot:
 ----------
    Refer to the README files available under
    /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/sources/libs/azure_protocol_adaptor
    for detailed documentation on prerequisites and usages of Azure protocol
    adaptor with the message broker plugin for sending messages to cloud.

 Kafka:
 ------
    Refer to the README file available under
    /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/sources/libs/kafka_protocol_adaptor
    for detailed documentation on prerequisites and usages of kafka protocol
    adaptor with the message broker plugin for sending messages to cloud.

 AMQP (rabbitmq):

2. Purpose:
===============================================================================

This sample builds on top of the service-maker deepstream_test1 sample to demonstrate to use
"nvmsgconv" and "nvmsgbroker" plugins in the pipeline. Create EventMessageUserMetadata
type of meta and attach to buffer. EventMessageUserMetadata is used for different types
 of objects e.g. vehicle, person etc.

===============================================================================
3. Usage:
===============================================================================

  Run with the h264 elementary stream or YAML pipeline config file.
   With YAML Pipeline config approach, user can modify the config file to configure
   pipeline properties.

    $ python3 deepstream_test4.py <h264_elementary_stream>

    OR

    $ python3 deepstream_test4.py <YAML pipeline config file>
