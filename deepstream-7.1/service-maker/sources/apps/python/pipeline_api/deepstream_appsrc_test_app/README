===============================================================================
1. Prerequisites:
===============================================================================

pytorch is required to run the test app. To install pytorch, run following commands:

  $ pip3 install torch

===============================================================================
2. Purpose:
===============================================================================

The sample app demonstrates how to create a BufferProvider for a Feeder class
and how to create a BufferRetriever for a receiver class. A Feeder with customized
BufferProvider can be used to inject user data to the DS pipeline, and a receiver
with a customized BufferRetriever can be used to extract buffer data from the
pipeline.

===============================================================================
3. Usage:
===============================================================================

Ensure that you are using the expected diplay port like this (if required)
  $ export DISPLAY=:0

  $ python3 deepstream_appsrc_test.py file:///opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/samples/streams/sample_720p.mp4
